# Configuring your stream team

The mainframe is set up to handle the following events for your stream team:

```
- Go live/offline changes
- Automatic shout outs/join events for a team member's first chat message in a broadcaster's stream
```

Configure your stream team in `config.ts` with a streamer's username and user ID.
